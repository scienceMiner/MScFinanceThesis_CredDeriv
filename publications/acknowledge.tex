The work in this project was funded by myself. As of June 2008 I think
I have failed my exams so I'll submit the project but it will be a long time
before I can finish this course so I don't really know what to do.  I know that as of 
June 24thI will begin to apply for jobs and go back to doing what I did before only
14K poorer. I've also had no MSc supervision.
