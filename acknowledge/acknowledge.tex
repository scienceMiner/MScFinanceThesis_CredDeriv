I am indebted to my supervisor, Mark Levene, not only for his
continual support, advice, and encouragement, throughout the term of
my research but also for the numerous stimulating discussions we have had
on databases, data mining, and many other research issues.  Similarly,
thanks go to Sean Holden, my second supervisor. I would also
like to thank Jose Borges, Wilfred Ng, Nadav Zin, and many other
colleagues at UCL for making my studies here even more enjoyable.

Thanks to the various anonymous reviewers of our papers who have
unknowingly improved the content of this thesis.

I would like to thank my parents,
to whom I dedicate this thesis, and without
whose love and support I would surely not now be in
the position of writing these thesis acknowledgements. I also thank
Deborah for her patience and support.
